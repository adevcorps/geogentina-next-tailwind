                <ul>
                    <li>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No
                    purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
                    then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                <h3>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
                <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
                <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
                    transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
                    improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
                    within a secure environment.</p>
                <h3>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>

                    Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data
                    we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <Link href="mailto:info@geogentia.com">info@geogentia.com</Link>.</p>
                <h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
                <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
                <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <Link href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">National Data Protection Authorities</Link>.</p>
                <p>If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: <Link href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">Swiss Data Protections</Link>.</p>
                <p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw
                    your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
                <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other
                    than consent.</p>
                <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at

                <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
                    At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
                    be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
                <h3>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
                <p>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>
                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if
                    any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would
                    like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>

                <p>Verification process</p>
                <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it
                    with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on
                    file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
                <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if
                    we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
                    additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
                <p>Other privacy rights You may object to the processing of your personal information. You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information. You can designate

                    to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
